# Tune
## Overview

An app that will allow users to log-in using JWT, have a custom user profile, and be able to use the music review platform.  Users can add artists, albums, genres, and reviews on albums with full CRUD.  A recommended page exists that reads the logged-in user's preferences and serves an album up as a recommendation.  This is accomplished utilizing django querying in the views and serializers.  This app has a robust back-end with a reg-ex search feature, many-to-many relationships, and data refinement to send only as much data as necessary.

## User Stories
### MVP Goals
- As a user, I would like add albums, artists, genres and reviews.
- As a user, I would like to be able to register / log in with JWT.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for all objects.

### Stretch Goals
- As a user, I would like albums to be recommended to me.
- As a user, I would like to 'like' other peoples posts and have it update live.  
- As a user, I would like to be able to upload a profile picture.
 
## Hurdles
- MUI dependencies (styling will always be my downfall)
